## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an all-round Computer Science enthusiast guided by a pursuit of
building high-quality digital tools with sizable real-world applications.

To that end, I maintain a split
[academic](https://oleks.info/research.html) and
[industrial](https://oleks.info/industry.html) lifestyle. I am an avid
programmer, a [passionate teacher](https://oleks.info/teaching.html),
and an [Open Source enthusiast](https://oleks.info/projects.html).

I was born in 1990 in Kyiv, Ukraine, but have been living in
Scandinavia since the age of 10. I tend to surprise people with my
affluent Danish and Ukrainian at no expense of my English skills.
