### Notable Projects

#### BSc Project


  * **Title:** Termination analysis of first order programs
  * **Year:** 2012
  * **Grade:** 12 (A)
  * **Supervisor:** Jakob Grue Simonsen
  * **Summary:** I got acquainted with size-change termination
    (due to Neil D. Jones), and implemented a small first order
    programming language in Haskell with a size-change termination
    checker. Inspired by both functional programming and soviet-era
    ternary (rather than binary) computer architectures, the language
    used *doubly* (rather than singly) linked lists as a basic data
    structure.
