I have a general research interest in **programming paradigms design
and implementation**. I am driven by a recurring passion to alleviate
the (human) challenges involved in programming in various domains.

My research then tends to have multiple tiers:

  1. Identify some challenges that programmers have when programming in
     the particular domain. Obtaining data on this is generally
     hard. For instance, because programming language design and
     implementation does not tend to be driven by empirical, but rather,
     anecdotal evidence.

  2. Hypothesise improvements, design and implement them in the form
     of alternative programming languages or runtimes.

  3. Evaluate whether the hypothesized programming paradigm is really
     somehow "better" than what was found challenging in (1).

As such and overall, I have also gained a research interest in
**Computer Science Education**, **Software Engineering**,
**Human-Computer Interaction**, and **Information Retrieval**.

At present (2024), I am in particular interested in advancing the
state of the art of programming **adaptive multi-agent systems**,
where multiple agents cooperate towards a common objective in highly
dynamic environments.
