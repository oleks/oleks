<p>
    I am an all-round Computer Science enthusiast guided by a pursuit of
    building high-quality digital tools with sizable real-world applications.
<p>

<p>
    To that end, I maintain a split <a href="/research.html">academic</a>
    and <a href="/industry.html">industrial</a> lifestyle. I am an
    <a href="https://github.com/oleks/">avid programmer</a>, a
    <a href="/teaching.html">passionate teacher</a>, and an
    <a href="/projects.html">Open Source enthusiast</a>.
</p>

<p>
    I was born in 1990 in Kyiv, Ukraine, but have been living in Scandinavia since the age of 10. I tend to surprise people with
    my affluent Danish and Ukrainian at no expense of my English skills.
