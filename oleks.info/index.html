<p>
    I am an all-round Computer Science enthusiast guided by a pursuit of
    building high-quality digital tools with sizable real-world applications.
<p>

<p>
    To that end, I maintain an academic lifestyle with a focus on both
    <a href="/teaching.html">teaching</a> and
    <a href="/research.html">research</a>, while keeping at least one
    foot in the <a href="industry.html">industry</a>.
</p>

<p>
    I am an avid programmer, a passionate teacher, and an Open Source enthusiast.
</p>

<p>
    I was born in 1990 in Kyiv, Ukraine, but have been living in Scandinavia
    (Denmark and Norway) since the age of 10. I tend to surprise people with
    my affluent Danish and Ukrainian at no expense of my English skills.
